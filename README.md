# Talk

We want to offer you a platform to speak, to teach and to try out new things!

Do you want to talk about how your team handled a scaling challenge? Do want want to shed some light on your take on diversification? Are you interested in sharing thoughts on specific technologies? Or do you want to try out a new way of facilitating a Scrum Ceremony?

Then this is the place to submit your idea! 

Other examples:

You can submit your idea by creating a new issue. Just fill out your form, give us an idea of what you want to do/talk about and how long it will be.
